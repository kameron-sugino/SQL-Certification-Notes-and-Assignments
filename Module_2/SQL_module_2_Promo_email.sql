/*Exercise 4: Consider any edge cases. If we sent an email to everyone in the results of this query, what would we want to filter out. Add in any extra filtering that you think would make this email better. For example should we include deleted users? Should we send this email to users who already ordered the item they viewed most recently?

I CAN COALESCE THE IDs BY SPECIFYING IN THE SELECT() STATEMENT_ID
We filter out events before a specific time (can make it automated)
and it left joins to the orders table by user_id and item_id to find users who have already ordered the last item they viewed (left join creates nulls where the user_id and item_id don't match the order table, so we can separate out all the null values from the orders table)

I can also get rid of one of the nested queries (where I pull out the ranked_views) by specifying in the where statement at the end with the others.
